\begin{abstract}
In this term paper for EE4321 VHDL with Dr. Salamy, an investigation is made 
into the advantages of pipelined architectures/dataflows through the lense of
common encryption algorithms. Two reference papers are investigated and 
analyzed, one implementing DES and the other implementing AES.
