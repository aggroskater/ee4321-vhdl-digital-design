Project 5 - Sequence Detector with Moore Machine
================================================

The system has one input 'x' and one output 'z'.

Detect the following input sequence:

1,0,1,1,0,0,1

The output 'z' is 1 only if the input had those 
seven values during the last seven clock cycles.
