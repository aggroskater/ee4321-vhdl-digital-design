==========================

All of the lab projects are described in the lab manual in the root of this 
repository.

- **Project 1**: An excess-3 BCD function. Basic intro to VHDL and testing.
- **Project 2**: A 4-bit RCA. Introduction to modular design and extended 
testing with assertions.
- **Project 3**: A 4-bit CLA. Continuation of modular design and testing.
- **Project 4**: A 4-bit ALU. Significantly more work than previous labs.
  Integration of numerous sub-modules into a larger top-level module and
testing over both the sub-modules and top-level module.
